## Whats going on with the bot?

Well as some of you know, Corrupt Bump is having some strange uptime lately since Discord did that restart to all bots with the "Message Content Indent" and Corrupt Bump was affected, so our devloper has been work hard on fixing it, and the bot worked!
But now we ran into a big problem, where it keeps poping up with an error (And no, Jon doesn't need any help) about a channel or that the bot can't connext through its webhook with when it joins or leaves a server, so we decided that we might just delete all discord server data from the database and take it from there!
